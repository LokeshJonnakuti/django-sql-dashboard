*Django app for building dashboards using raw SQL queries*

Brings a useful subset of [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) to Django.

This currently only works with PostgreSQL.

This is **very early alpha**. You should not yet trust this code, especially with regards to security. Do not run this in production (yet)!
